# Recommendations

A loosely organized list of things I love and go out of my way to recommend.

## Nix

- [nix](https://nixos.org/): Cross-platform package manager with one of the largest and up-to-date registries in the world. By design, it supports project-local development environments with pinned dependencies.
- [nixos](https://nixos.org/): Declarative Linux distro built on Nix. It's like Docker on steriods. Instead of pinning development shells, pin everything from your linux kernel to your terminal emulator. Bricked your boot process? Just roll back to the last working version.
- [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager): User configuration layer built on the NixOS module system. Makes your configs portable and identical across Linux distros, macOS, and WSL.
- [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin): Manages the macOS host as though it's a NixOS system. (You'd still use Home Manager for everything cross-platform.)
- [colmena](https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena): Remote deployment tool built for NixOS. Ideal for managing pet servers such as home labs.
- [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv): Integrates with `direnv` to automatically load development environments when you `cd` into a project.
- [noogle](https://noogle.dev/): Search engine for the Nix language. Particularly useful for discovering `lib` functions.

## Terminal Tools

- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom): Quite possibly the greatest system monitor ever written.
- [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta): The fanciest git diff viewer you'll ever find.
- [doggo](https://github.com/mr-karan/doggo/): An alternative to `dig` that's so good, you'll want to use it.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): A `find` replacement with a great command line interface. It's significantly faster and easier to use.
- [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow): A markdown renderer built for the terminal. This makes documentation much more comfortable to absorb.
- [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/): An incredibly powerful shell with structured data and an even stronger commitment to pipeline processing.
- [rage](https://github.com/str4d/rage): A small and simple encryption tool that works on public keys.
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): A `grep`/`ag` replacement, and wicked fast, too.
- [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim) or [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): Fuzzy finders. Fantastic for finding files, searching notes, or sorting through massive troves of unstructured text.
- [spotify-player](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player): An ncurses-style Spotify client.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): You know what this is. I'm still going to recommend it.
- [viu](https://github.com/atanunq/viu): Renders images in the terminal using colored ascii art. Especially handy when working over SSH.
- [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm): An insanely powerful cross-platform terminal emulator configurable (and scriptable!) by config file.
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): Quick navigation around your file system. Phenomenal for jumping between projects without remembering the exact path.

## Podcasts

- [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)<br />

- [Hardcore History (Dan Carlin)](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/)<br />

- [Philosophize This!](https://www.philosophizethis.org/)<br />
  Before coming to this podcast, I had no real exposure to the field of philosophy. The podcast proved a fantastic gateway drug, and its broad overviews gave me enough context to navigate the reading landscape on my own.

## Fiction Books

- [Diaspora (Greg Egan)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156785.Diaspora): The most densely packed sci-fi book in existence. Egan often explores the nature of reality and consciousness. This book dials it to 11 and just keeps going.
