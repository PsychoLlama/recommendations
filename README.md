# Recommendations
A loosely organized list of things I love and go out of my way to recommend.

## Terminal Tools
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty): I use Alacritty as my
  terminal emulator across MacOS and Linux. It's configured through a yaml
  file, which makes it very easy to share configs between computers (*scowls
  at iTerm*).
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): You know what this is. I'm still going
  to recommend it.
- [Nix](https://nixos.org/): A cross-platform package manager. All my devtools
  are installed and managed by Nix. It's phenomenally well designed.
- [Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow): A markdown renderer built for
  the terminal. This makes documentation much more confortable to absorb.
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): A `grep`/`ag` replacement,
  and wicked fast, too.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): A `find` replacement with a great
  command line interface. It's significantly faster and easier to use.
- [viu](https://github.com/atanunq/viu): Renders images in the terminal using
  colored ascii art. Especially handy when working over SSH.
- [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim) or
  [fzf](https://github.com/lotabout/skim): Fuzzy finders. Fantastic for
  finding files, searching notes, or sorting through massive troves of
  unstructured text.
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): Quick navigation around
  your file system. Phenomenal for jumping between projects without
  remembering the exact path.

## Vim
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/): IMO vim is getting left behind
  in favor of Neovim. They're leading the charge for new editor features.
- [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim): This provides IDE-quality
  editor features right in vim. Powered by the [LSP
  architecture](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (no
  startup penalty).
- [splitjoin.vim](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/splitjoin.vim): A convenient
  way of splitting things from one line into multiple statements (or reversing
  it).
- [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree): I've never found vim's 2D
  edit history easy to navigate. This plugin provides a nicer graphical
  interface.

## Browser Extensions
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/): Most of you already know this ad
  blocker. I didn't for a while. It's pretty great.
- [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium): Vim keybindings for navigating
  the web. It works surprisingly well.
- [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/): A tool for injecting custom
  CSS. I use this to hide annoying UI elements and apply custom dark themes.
