# Recommendations

A loosely organized list of things I love and go out of my way to recommend.

## Terminal Tools

- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom): Quite possibly the greatest system monitor ever written.
- [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta): The fanciest git diff viewer you'll ever find.
- [doggo](https://github.com/mr-karan/doggo/): An alternative to `dig` that's so good, you'll want to use it.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): A `find` replacement with a great command line interface. It's significantly faster and easier to use.
- [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow): A markdown renderer built for the terminal. This makes documentation much more comfortable to absorb.
- [nix](https://nixos.org/): A cross-platform package manager. All my devtools are installed and managed by Nix. It's phenomenally well designed.
- [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/): An incredibly powerful shell with structured data and an even stronger commitment to pipeline processing.
- [rage](https://github.com/str4d/rage): A small and simple encryption tool that works on public keys.
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): A `grep`/`ag` replacement, and wicked fast, too.
- [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim) or [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): Fuzzy finders. Fantastic for finding files, searching notes, or sorting through massive troves of unstructured text.
- [spotify-player](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player): An ncurses-style Spotify client.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): You know what this is. I'm still going to recommend it.
- [viu](https://github.com/atanunq/viu): Renders images in the terminal using colored ascii art. Especially handy when working over SSH.
- [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm): An insanely powerful cross-platform terminal emulator configurable (and scriptable!) by config file.
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): Quick navigation around your file system. Phenomenal for jumping between projects without remembering the exact path.

## Vim

- [markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim/): A very good markdown previewer with scroll sync and tons of rendering features.
- [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/): IMO vim is getting left behind in favor of Neovim. They're leading the charge for new editor features.
- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/): General purpose command palette. Extensible, but powerful out of the box.
- [treesj](https://github.com/Wansmer/treesj): A convenient way of splitting things from one line into multiple statements (or reversing it).
- [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree): I've never found vim's 2D edit history easy to navigate. This plugin provides a nicer graphical interface.
- [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround): Manage delimiters like a pro.

## Browser Extensions

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/): Not technically just a browser extension. This password manager is open source, self-hostable, and has official clients for about every platform, including command line.
- [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/): A tool for injecting custom CSS. I use this to hide annoying UI elements and apply custom dark themes.
- [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium): Vim keybindings for navigating the web. It works surprisingly well.
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/): Most of you already know this ad blocker. I didn't for a while. It's pretty great.

## Podcasts

- [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)<br />

- [Hardcore History (Dan Carlin)](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/)<br />

- [Philosophize This!](https://www.philosophizethis.org/)<br />
  Before coming to this podcast, I had no real exposure to the field of philosophy. The podcast proved a fantastic gateway drug, and its broad overviews gave me enough context to navigate the reading landscape on my own.
